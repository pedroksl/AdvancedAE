## Features

### Advanced Pattern Providers

AdvancedAE adds Advanced Pattern Providers. They are crafted using standard or extended pattern providers, and retain the same inventory size but with additional features!
There are also upgrade items that can convert placed pattern providers or improve their capacity without the need to remove the patterns inside.

By utilizing an Advanced Pattern Encoder, you can modify Processing Patterns to select to which face each input will be sent, eliminating the need for multiple pipes and used sides to interact with machines that require them.

### Quantum Computer

Quantum Computer is a special type of Crafting Unit. It is capable of running an unlimited amount of crafting tasks, as long as it has enough crafting storage.
Furthermore, all of these concurrent tasks are able to share all co-processor present in the Quantum Computer Multiblock!
The Quantum Core can be used as a standalone crafting unit with 256M and 8 co-processors. Byu creating a multiblock with one of them, you can extend those capabilities by a large amount.
Specially when using two special block types: The Quantum Data Entangler and the Quantum Multi-Threader, which multiply storage and co-processors present in the multiblock by 4, respectively.
The multiblock can be scaled up to a 5x5x5, and consumes a single channel for all of this computing power!
